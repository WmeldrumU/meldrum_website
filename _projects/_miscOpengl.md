**Projects from CS 5650 Interactive Computer Graphics** 


The Western United States Pipe Band Association (WUSPBA) approached the University of Utah to a solution for event management and registration. It turns out they were using an outdated raquetball tournament system called R2. Being of Scottish heritage and in need of a good senior project, I suggested a complete remake of their current system. I lead a team of 5 students total (dubbed "HomeTeam") and was the main point of contact between the two parties. I acted as a web dev in ASP.NET, managed AWS systems, and kept in consistent contact with each team member to remove any obstacles. 

This experience taught me so much: how to bond a group of five strangers working together, how to make decisions as a leader, and how to deal with development complications in a long-form project.
