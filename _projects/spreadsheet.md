**Spreadsheet software allowing simultaneous editing, undoing, and redoing over remote connections. The client is written in C# and the server written in C++. Required knowledge of event-driven networking, socket programming, regular expressions, JSON, and creation of specification documents for team coordination.** 


This was a group project with 5 other students. We created a unified design document before writing a single line of code. Because of this, each one of us were able to understand our software (and its drawbacks) and could address them during the design phase. Our team was split up into two groups of three people. I was the "representative" of my team, which focused on the client while the other team worked on the server. Any hiccups in the process were addressed through quick group meetings and an executive decision between the two team representatives. Compared to my other group projects, this one had the best communication, which helped us achieve a top 3 implementation compared to our class.
