**Unreal Engine project showing capabilities of stylized rendering in VR. The environment has three “windows” that the user can pick up and look through. Depending on the window, the environment will be cel-shaded, 1-bit shaded, or shaded with cross-hatching.** 


This was my final for my Virtual Reality class. I wanted to explore the idea of "windows" the player would look through. Each window has a different stylized shading. This required knowledge of -- as well as experimentation with -- Unreal's graphics pipeline. Using deferred rendering and manipulating stencil buffers was challenging -- but after diving deeper into Unreal's Blueprint programming, I was able to achieve my concept.
